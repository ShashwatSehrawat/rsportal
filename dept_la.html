                            <p >Welcome to the department of Liberal Arts, IIT Hyderabad.  The department offers a vibrant and challenging environment for post-graduate and research scholars in areas that include Cultural Studies, Economics, English (Literature and Language), Psychology, Linguistics, Sociology and Social Anthropology. The department encourages a great deal of collaborative and interdisciplinary work that corresponds to the research interests and academic progress of the students as well as faculty. While the primary concern of the department is to create an ambience that facilitates the students and researchers to carry out academic endeavors in an innovative fashion, we also aim at providing a stress-free environment that is conducive to teaching and learning. Currently, the department offers two programs at research level, specifically M.Phil and Ph.D. Along with this, a dual-degree research program is also being offered.<br />
                            The department of Liberal Arts believes in the student-centric teaching approach, providing a good deal of creative and interactive freedom for the student. We believe, such an environment provides students a gateway to tap their potential thereby resulting in personal as well as academic growth. The department strives to educate and impart knowledge in the relevant fields that not only makes the students torch-bearers of knowledge, but also produces works that best serve the institute and the nation.</p>
