							</header>
							<p>The Department of Electrical Engineering (EE) at IIT Hyderabad offers a vibrant environment for under graduate, post graduate education and research in many areas of Electrical Engineering. This is one of the earliest department started in IITH. Faculty members of the department are engaged in cutting edge technology research and also very passionate about teaching. The department currently has 22 faculty members, 3 staff and 328 (B.Tech. - 178, M.Tech. - 89 and Ph.D. - 61) students.<br />
                            The department has excellent research infrastructure and laboratories with qualified staff and latest equipment. Students get practical experience of how things work in real world. The faculty instill a passion for research in students by continuously supporting them, giving them deeper insights into the subject matter and thereby creating an undying enthusiasm and interest in the subject. provides vibrant platform to develop cutting edge technological advancements. Our department has young and dynamic faculty with rich expertise in the field of study. Department encourages collaboration with other groups within and external to institute promoting inter-disciplinary research. Through the funding from various govt. and corporate agencies, we addresses a gamut of technological challenges. Each of faculty and student profiles give you an idea of the research interests and contributions.<br />
                            The broad areas of research which are the focus of the department are as follows:
                            <h3>Communications and Signal Processing (CSP)</h3>The main research areas of this group are Cooperative Communication, Speech and Multi-Media Signal Processing, Source Coding, Space-Time Coding, Information Theory, Cognitive Radio/Radar, Cyber Physical Systems, Image and Video Quality Assessment.
                            <h3>Microelectronics and VLSI (Micro)</h3>The main thrust of this group is on affordability, low power and portability. The goal is to push the limits of silicon in achieving the above as well as being on the frontier of new viable technologies. The research areas that are focused on are 3-D ICs, Analog/RF IC design, Micro scale Energy Harvesting, Pervasive Computing, Data acquisition systems, Biosensors development.
                            <h3>Power Electronics and Power Systems (PEPS)</h3>The main research areas of this group are Smart Grids, Micro Grids, Power System Dynamics, Multilevel Inverters, Switched Mode Power Conversion, Wide Area Monitoring, Protection and Control, Information Technology Architectures, Common Information Model (CIM).
                            <h3>Systems and Control (Syscon)</h3>The main research areas of this group are Identification and Estimation, Fault Diagnosis, Micro Grid/ Smart Grid, Advanced Control applications, Statistical Process Monitoring and Control.
                            <h3>Machine Learning  (ML): </h3>The main research areas of this group are Statistical Pattern Recognition and Deep Learning. More information can be found <a href="https://www.iith.ac.in/~sumohana/mtech_in_ml/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.<br /> 
                            Each of the above research domains have various labs undertaking active research on areas like Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), Cloud Converged Radio Access Networks (CCRAN), Design and Fabrication of MEMS Devices, Micro/Smart grids, etc.</p>
